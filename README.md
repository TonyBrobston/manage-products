# manage-products

This is a simple tool that allows you to export products from Big Commerce as XML, import the products into this tool, search for a common section of the product name that is used across multiple products, and modify fields that are shared, then download the updated XML, to then import into Big Commerce.  

This tool is deployed at https://tonybrobston.github.io/manage-products
